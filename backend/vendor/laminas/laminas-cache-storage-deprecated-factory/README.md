# laminas-cache-storage-deprecated-factory

This component can be used to migrate to laminas-cache v3 in a more backwards compatible way.

This component retains the behavior of `Laminas\Cache\StorageFactory` which is still used in several `laminas-*` components.

This factory will not provide support for laminas-cache v4+ and is only meant to be used as a temporary solution in combination with other laminas components.
